% Inputs:
%   u: Matrix of the horitzontal velocity components
%   v: Matrix of the vertical velocity components
%   L: length of a side of the analysed square
% Outputs:
%   u_conv_num: Solution of the convective terms of horitzontal velocity
%   v_conv_num: Solution of the convective terms of vertical velocity

        % Unlike the diffusive, here we can't beat the deltas because 
        % there are sums in the middle, but if we group it and make a 
        % common factor, we save calculation capacity.
