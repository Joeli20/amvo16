% Inputs:
%   u: Matrix of the horitzontal velocity components
%   v: Matrix of the vertical velocity components
% Outputs:
%   u_diff_num: Solution of the diffusive terms of horitzontal velocity
%   v_diff_num: Solution of the diffusive terms of vertical velocity

N = size(u,1) - 2;

u_diff_num = zeros(N+2,N+2);

        % I have deleted the delta because in this case when it is squared 
        % it is canceled and thus we gain calculation time. NS2 Slide 16 
        % shows how it should be, which is the sx(i+1) - sx(i) below and 
        % then multiplied by sy(j) - sy(j-1), but for practical purposes 
        % it's the same distance in our case.
